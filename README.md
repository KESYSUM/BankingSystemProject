## Project Summary
This project is a simple banking system implemented in C++. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, check balances, and manage banking transactions. The system ensures basic security and efficient account handling.

## What I Did Well
- Implemented object-oriented programming principles such as **classes, encapsulation, and inheritance**.
- Designed a **structured menu system** for easy user navigation.
- Used **file handling** to store and retrieve account information.
- Included **error handling** to prevent invalid inputs.

## Areas for Improvement
- **Enhancing security**: Implementing password protection for accounts.
- **Optimizing file handling**: Using a database instead of text files for better efficiency.
- **Better UI**: Creating a graphical user interface instead of console-based interaction.

## Most Challenging Part
The hardest part was **managing file storage** efficiently. Ensuring data persistence while keeping file operations optimized took time. I overcame this by:
- Using **fstream library** in C++.
- Researching **efficient file I/O techniques**.

## Transferable Skills
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **File handling & data persistence**
- **Error handling & debugging**
- **User input validation**
- **Project structuring and documentation**

## Code Readability & Maintainability
To keep my code clean and maintainable, I:
- Used **clear function names** and **comments**.
- Followed **consistent indentation and formatting**.
- Organized code into **multiple files** (`.cpp` and `.h`).
- Implemented **modular functions** for better readability.
