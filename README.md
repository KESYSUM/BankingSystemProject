# Banking System Project

## Project Summary
this project is a simple banking system written in c++. it lets users create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and manage transactions. the goal was to build a functional and user-friendly banking system that handles basic account operations while keeping things organized and efficient.

## what i did well
- used **object-oriented programming (oop)** to keep the code structured.  
- set up a **menu system** that makes navigation easy.  
- implemented **file handling** to save and load account data.  
- added **error handling** so the program doesn’t crash from bad inputs.  

## what could be better  
- **security**: adding account passwords would make it more realistic.  
- **file handling**: using a database instead of text files would improve performance.  
- **ui improvements**: right now, it’s all text-based. a simple gui would make it look better.  

## hardest part  
getting **file storage** to work right was tricky. i had to make sure account data was saved and loaded properly without losing info. i solved this by:  
- using the **fstream library** for file input/output.  
- testing different ways to store and format the data.  

## useful skills from this project  
- **oop (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)**  
- **file handling (saving/loading data)**  
- **error handling & debugging**  
- **user input validation**  
- **writing readable & maintainable code**  

## how i kept the code clean  
- used **clear function names** and **comments** to explain what’s happening.  
- kept the formatting **consistent** for readability.  
- split the code into **multiple files** (`.cpp` and `.h`) to stay organized.  
- made sure each function does **one specific thing** to keep it modular.
